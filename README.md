## About Me
Hello World! I’m a driven Software Engineer with hands‑on experience building web applications across diverse domains.

Despite my young age I've been building since 2021, when I had my first contact with coding at high school. Since then, I've been improving my problem solving skills and contributing to different projects.

I am proud of being approved in [first place](https://servicos.nc.ufpr.br/documentos/ps2025/resultado/2fase/concorrencia/077_00.html) at my university and having created a system that supports my father and his company in helping other people [find their jobs](https://mlrh.com.br). But, most importantly, I am proud of having built this journey with honesty, discipline and drive.
